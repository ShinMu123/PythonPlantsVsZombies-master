# TODO: Add More Levels to Plants vs Zombies Game

## Plan Overview
- Current game has 5 levels (level_1.json to level_5.json)
- Add 5 more levels (level_6.json to level_10.json) with increasing difficulty
- Each level increases zombie count and introduces tougher zombie types

## Steps
- [x] Create level_6.json: Increase zombie count, add BucketheadZombie
- [x] Create level_7.json: More zombies, add NewspaperZombie
- [x] Create level_8.json: Even more zombies, mix of all types
- [x] Create level_9.json: High difficulty, frequent spawns
- [x] Create level_10.json: Final level, maximum difficulty
- [x] Test the game to ensure new levels load correctly
- [x] Update TODO.md to mark testing as completed
